Eaglet Fold is a **VS Code extension** that intelligently folds long [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) class lists in your HTML (or JSX, TSX, etc.) files.  
It keeps your code **clean, compact, and readable** ‚Äî while allowing you to unfold and edit classes instantly when needed.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Folding**  
  Long Tailwind class lists are collapsed into a short preview (e.g., `bg-blue-500 ... text-white`) so your code stays neat.

- **Hover to Expand**  
  Simply hover over the folded classes to preview the full list.

- **Click to Unfold**  
  Expand the folded section with one click and edit directly.

- **Global Fold/Unfold All**  
  Manage folding across the whole file with one command.

- **Per-File Memory** *(optional)*  
  The extension remembers which lines were folded when switching between files.
